  <div id="myDiv">
    <p>This is some text.</p>
  </div>
  <script>
    //Attempting to access a property of an element before it's fully parsed
    //This is an example, the timing issue could occur with any asynchronous operation
    //that modifies the DOM before the page is fully loaded
    window.addEventListener('load', function() {
      console.log(document.getElementById('myDiv').querySelector('p').textContent);
    });
    //This will result in an error if the script executes before the div is fully parsed.
    //It can happen in different situations, so timing of how things occur is important to check.
